If users feel that using only an ID and password to log in to BioStar 2 is not secure enough or want to enhance their account security, they can use the <Cmd sid="common.fingerprintLogin" /> feature to improve their account security.

<Cmd sid="common.fingerprintLogin" /> enhances user account security by adding a fingerprint authentication step using a fingerprint scanner to the existing ID and password login method.

The supported fingerprint scanners are as follows:

* BioMini

* BioMini Plus 2

## Before Using

:::caution

When using <Cmd sid="common.fingerprintLogin" /> with the main Administrator (ID 1) account, if fingerprint authentication becomes unavailable, the main Administrator account may be permanently unable to log in. Please be cautious.

* If login becomes impossible due to fingerprint issues, please contact [Suprema Technical Support](https://support.supremainc.com).

:::

:::info

* When a user with <Cmd sid="common.fingerprintLogin" /> enabled accesses BioStar 2 through the <Cmd sid="cloud.title" />, fingerprint authentication for login is not supported, so <Cmd sid="common.fingerprintLogin" /> cannot be used.

* <Cmd sid="common.fingerprintLogin" /> cannot be used if the <Cmd sid="biostar.login" /> option is enabled for an Active Directory server account.

* Users with <Cmd sid="common.fingerprintLogin" /> enabled cannot be registered for BioStar 2 services other than BioStar 2 AC.

    :::info

    * The scan time limit is fixed at 18 seconds and cannot be changed.

    * Fingerprint scanning can be attempted up to three times consecutively. If the fingerprint is not accurately scanned within these three attempts, authentication will fail.

    * In the case of authentication failure, click the <Image src='/img/ico-retry.png' ico /> to attempt fingerprint authentication again. Up to two retry attempts are allowed.

        * If authentication fails after two retry attempts, the process will revert to the ID and Password login step.
