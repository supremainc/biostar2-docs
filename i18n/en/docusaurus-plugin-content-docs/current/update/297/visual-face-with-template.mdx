In BioStar 2 v2.9.6 and earlier versions, synchronizing users including visual faces, involved syncing actual images, which resulted in longer synchronization times. Additionally, the actual facial images stored on the server or device could cause privacy-related issues.

Starting with BioStar 2 v2.9.7, the synchronization protocol has been improved to only transmit templates, excluding the actual images during user synchronization. Additionally, an option to prevent storing the actual images in the visual face can be used to prevent privacy-related issues.

:::note

**List of devices that can synchronize visual face using templates only**

* FaceStation F2 firmware v2.2.0 or later

* BioStation 3 firmware v1.3.1 or later

* BioEntry W3 firmware v1.0.0 or later

:::

:::info

To synchronize visual faces as templates only during user synchronization, [비주얼 페이스 마이그레이션](#visual-face-migration) must be completed.

:::

## Before Start

import DocumentA from '../../common/_fsf2-firmware-support-discontinuation.mdx'

### Notes on Visual Face Template Types

Differences in Visual Face Template Types for FaceStation F2, BioStation 3, and BioEntry W3.

* **NPU Type**: BioStation 3, BioEntry W3

* **GPU Type**: FaceStation F2

:::note

*  **Synchronization Time Between Devices with Different Visual Face Template Types**

    Before performing <Cmd sid="user.list.visualFaceMigration.title" />, if BioStation 3 or BioEntry W3 is added to an environment using only FaceStation F2, synchronization will require extracting NPU-type templates from actual images due to differing template types. This process may take a significant amount of time, depending on the number of visual faces enrolled on the server.

* **Recommended to Enroll Visual Faces through Biostar 2**

    When enrolling visual faces without using the option to <Cmd sid="device.info.storeVisualFaceImage" /> on the device, only the template is synchronized with BioStar 2. As a result, it cannot be synchronized to devices with different visual face template types. Therefore, it is recommended to enroll visual faces through BioStar 2.

### Notes on Using Facestation F2 or Biostation 3 in Biostar 2 v2.9.7

:::caution

When using FaceStation F2 or BioStation 3 with BioStar 2 v2.9.7, it is recommended to upgrade to the latest firmware version.

The latest firmware can be downloaded from the [Suprema Download Center](https://download.supremainc.com).

:::

The user data file exported from BioStar 2 v2.9.7 contains only visual face templates and no actual images. Therefore, if using existing firmware on FaceStation F2 and BioStation 3, the user data file cannot be imported.

When <Cmd sid="menu.dataExport" /> from FaceStation F2 and BioStation 3, the data files can only be exported using firmware versions above the following:

* FaceStation F2 firmware v2.2.0 or later

* BioStation 3 firmware v1.3.1 or later

## How to Visual Face Migration {#visual-face-migration}

What is <Cmd sid="user.list.visualFaceMigration.title" />?

Visual Face Migration is a feature that generates two types of Visual Face templates from actual images of users already stored on the BioStar 2 server.

To synchronize Visual Face data as templates only, it is mandatory to perform <Cmd sid="user.list.visualFaceMigration.title" />.

:::caution

<Cmd sid="user.list.visualFaceMigration.title" /> can only be performed from an administrator account.

:::

1. Click <Cmd sid="common.gnb.user" />.

1. Click the <Image src='/img/common/ico-user-option.png' ico /> on the right and select <Cmd sid="user.list.visualFaceMigration.title" />.

    <Image src='/img/en/biostar-297-visual-face-migration-1.png' caption />

1. After checking the warning pop-up message, click <Cmd sid="button.continue" />. The <Cmd sid="user.list.visualFaceMigration.title" /> will proceed.

    :::caution

    * The larger the size of the registered visual face images for each user, the longer it may take to generate the templates.

    * For approximately 1,000 visual faces, the process takes about 18 minutes, although this may vary depending on server performance.

    * Do not navigate away from the current page while the migration is in progress.

    :::

1. When <Cmd sid="user.list.visualFaceMigration.title" /> is complete, a result pop-up will appear. It will show the total number of visual faces enrolled in BioStar 2, as well as the number of visual faces that were successfully migrated and those that failed.

    <Image src='/img/en/biostar-297-visual-face-migration-2.png' className='none' caption />

1. If the migration fails, you can download a list of users whose migration failed as a CSV file. Additionally, you can click <Cmd>Delete</Cmd> to remove all visual faces that failed to migrate at once.

## Feature to Not Store the User's Actual Image

### Store Visual Face Image

Set whether to store both the actual image and the template in the visual face or to store only the template without storing the actual image.

1. Go to <Cmd sid="common.setting" /> → <Cmd sid="common.server" /> → <Cmd sid="settings.expertSettings.title" /> and activate <Cmd sid="settings.expertSettings.enableOptionLabel" /> to <Cmd sid="common.use" />.

    <Image src='/img/en/biostar-297-expert-setting-1.png' caption />

    :::caution

    If there are any changes made in the <Cmd sid="common.server" /> menu, click <Cmd sid="button.apply" /> to save the changes before activating <Cmd sid="settings.expertSettings.enableOptionLabel" />.

    :::

1. Click the <Image src='/img/en/ico-expert-setting.png' ico /> to enter <Cmd sid="settings.expertSettings.detail.title" /> and set <Cmd sid="settings.expertSettings.detail.storeVisualFaceImageOptionLabel" /> as desired.

    <Image src='/img/en/biostar-297-expert-setting-2.png' caption />

    * <Cmd sid="common.use" />: This is the default setting. Visual face stores both the actual image and the template.

    * <Cmd sid="common.notUse" />: Only the template is stored without saving the actual image for visual face. If disabling this by setting it to <Cmd sid="common.notUse" />, carefully read the warning pop-up before proceeding.

    :::note

    **Caution When Disabling Store Visual Face Image Option**
    
    * Disabling this feature will delete all stored visual face images, and future enrolled visual faces will only store the template without the image.

    * If the enrolled visual faces do not have both types of templates, this feature cannot be disabled. Please proceed with [Visual Face Migration](#visual-face-migration).

    * If this feature is disabled and <Cmd sid="menu.dataImport" /> is performed, the data file cannot be imported if it contains invalid visual face templates. To resolve this issue, temporarily enable this feature before importing the data file.

1. Click <Cmd sid="button.apply" /> to save the settings.
