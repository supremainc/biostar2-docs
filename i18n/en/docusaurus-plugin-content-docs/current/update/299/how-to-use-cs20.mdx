---

CoreStation 20 (CS-20/CS-20P) is Suprema's new controller that enables easy implementation of two-door access control.<br/>Compared to the existing four-door model, CoreStation (CS-40), it is lighter and optimized for RFID card-based access control.<br/>It can store up to 500,000 user infomation and supports compatibility with various interfaces.<br/>In particular, the CS-20P model supports easy installation with PoE+ (Power over Ethernet) and is equipped with a SAM card slot for enhanced security.

This document provides an overview of the CoreStation 20 menu in BioStar 2 and explains how to create doors.

:::info

* CoreStation 20 does not support wireless door locks.

* CoreStation 20 does not support biometric authentication (such as face or fingerprint); only card authentication is supported.<br/>If biometric authentication is required, it is recommended to use CoreStation (CS-40).
