The Door Interface is a device that securely and flexibly connects two doors and four readers.<br/>Authentication is possible even in offline environments using <Cmd sid="device.info.facilityCode" />, and the device supports security-focused features such as AC failure, tamper, and fire alarm.<br/>By integrating with CoreStation (CS-40) or CoreStation 20 (CS-20, CS-20P) controllers, a robust access control architecture is provided that flexibly supports a wide range of system environments from small to large enterprises.

This document provides instructions for setting <Cmd sid="device.info.facilityCode" /> for the Door Interface in BioStar 2.
