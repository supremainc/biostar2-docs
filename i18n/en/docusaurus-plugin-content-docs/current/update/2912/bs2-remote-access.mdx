Remote access is a new feature that replaces the existing BioStar 2 CLOUD feature. This feature allows to securely access internal networks from external networks using the ngrok service. This feature enables access to the BioStar 2 server remotely without firewall settings or port forwarding.

:::info

* The Remote Access feature is requires a **BioStar 2 Remote Access** license.

* When purchasing the remote access license, Suprema generates a bot account, endpoint, and license document for remote access use on the ngrok Suprema site.

:::

:::caution

* Remote Access is provided through ngrok’s third‑party tunneling service. Remote Access is provided through ngrok’s third‑party tunneling service. Before using this feature, please review [Remote Access Feature Agreement](https://docs.supremainc.com/legal/eula#remote-access-agreement).

* BioStar 2 simply supports the connection by calling the ngrok API, but the security, safety, and continuity of internet connectivity entirely depend on the ngrok service. Therefore, Suprema assumes no responsibility for any security incidents, data loss, or system breaches that may occur during the use of this feature.
