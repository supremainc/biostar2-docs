**Notice on FaceStation F2 v1.x.x Firmware Support Discontinuation**

Starting with BioStar 2 v2.9.7, we have enhanced synchronization performance by modifying the process to transmit templates exclusively when synchronizing a user’s visual face to the device.

Given the differences in visual face algorithms, FaceStation F2 v1.x.x won’t sync well with the new BioStar 2. Therefore, we’ve decided to end support for FaceStation F2 v1.x.x from BioStar 2 v2.9.7 onward.

If you are currently using FaceStation F2 v1.x.x firmware, kindly upgrade your FaceStation F2 to the latest firmware to utilize BioStar 2 v2.9.7.

The latest firmware can be downloaded from the [Suprema Download Center](https://download.supremainc.com).
